Ludum Dare 26 - MinimalistTD
===========

This is my entry to Ludum Dare 26, the theme was *"Minimalism"*. My goal was to create a simplistic tower defence game with only two colors (black and white), balanced gameplay and a new engine (HaxeFlixel, been using flixel AS3 before). [Link to the LD page](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=16160). It ended up placing #171 overall.

A slightly improved version has been integrated into [flixel-demos](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-demos) and is [playable on the HaxeFlixel website](http://haxeflixel.com/demos/MinimalistTD/).
